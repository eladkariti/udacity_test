# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Move the Application load balancer and the wev service instance to the private subnet 
2. Add an APIGateway for the incoming request from the internet and NatGateway (public subnet) to connect the web instance in the private subnet
With thoses configuration the attacker won't have access to our web instance in the private network. 

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. we need to add IMA Role and Policy to the bucket and the privilege users to enable just them to get access to the secret S3 bucket.
2. we can also limit the the S3 bucket with accee control for specific ips if we know where are the privilege users
