Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Instance and load balancer need to move to a private subnet, keeps the web service on the public subnet can cause 
to the service to be compromised by attacker. Once we move the web servie to a private sunnet the attacker simulation 
won't have access to our web instance. 

# Poor practice 2
Previleged users can acces to the secret recipe directly Without IMA Role and Policy, in case of keys vulnerability users will be 
allowed to make any changes they want (delete, change), in addition we need to have a KMS for thoses S3 buckets.

# Poor practice 3
S3 doesn't have IMA Role and Plicies in a case were user's machine compromised and keys were stolen th attacker can make any changes on the 
S3 buckets, i would alow only read access on the bucket policy in this case. In addition we need to restrict the access to the Web Servie instance principle.  
Without the IMA Role and policies we can see that the Attack simulation instance will be able 
to make changes on the S3 bucket.

# Poor practice 3
Instance Role missconfigured, the instances role has a full access to s3. The uses can't make any updates on the S3
bucket so we need to update the Instance role to have a least privilege access to S3 (Read Only). 
This wil avoid from the Attack simulation instance to make unwelcome changes on our S3 bucket.
